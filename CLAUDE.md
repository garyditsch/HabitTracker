# Workflow
- make sure to follow the plan as described on prd.md
- after each phase of the plan, stop and ask for my approval before proceeding
- always try to make the least amount of changes to accomplish the goal, simple is better
- as tasks are completed on the todo.md document, make sure to check off each task
- at the end of each phase, make sure you add a summary section to the todo.md with all the updates you completed
